# BOOLEANS AND COMPARISON OPERATORS
-----------------------------------

* Introduction
--------------
Have you ever noticed that hyperlinks change color after you click them? If the link has been clicked, then the web browser renders it in purple, rather than blue. The programming concept 
that makes this possible is called conditionals.

This might be a simple example, but conditionals underlie the complex behavior of computer programs from Gmail, to Mario games, to Microsoft Office. Conditionals make it possible for 
programs to decide how to react to a wide variety of situations.

But computers aren’t intelligent—in order for them to make decisions they have to be programmed with a set of rules to follow.

In this lesson, we’ll explore how we write programs that can make decisions with conditionals.

* If Statements
---------------
We’re going to learn about a specific type of conditional called an if statement. An if statement follows this basic structure:

if (/*some condition*/) {
 // Do something...
}
 
The parentheses hold the condition we want the computer to check. If the condition is true, the code inside the code block ({ }) will run; if it’s not true, the code will not run.

The foundation of any conditional is the boolean data type. A boolean can have one of two values: TRUE or FALSE. Note that these are the words without quotation marks—the string "TRUE" is 
not the same as the boolean value TRUE. These values are not case sensitive, but we follow the convention of making them uppercase.

If we wanted to write code to approximate our hyperlink example from the previous exercise, we might write something like this:

$is_clicked = TRUE;
if ($is_clicked) {
  $link_color = "purple";
  echo $link_color;
}
 
In the code above, we ask the computer to check the $is_clicked variable as the condition. If its value is TRUE, the value of $link_color will be assigned "purple" and printed.

In the code above, were our condition not met, we’d skip over the code turning the link purple, but what should we do instead? If the link has been clicked, the color should be purple, 
otherwise it should be blue. We can include a block of code to run when the condition is not met with the keyword else:

$is_clicked = FALSE;
if ($is_clicked) {
  $link_color = "purple";
  echo $link_color;
} else {
  $link_color = "blue";
  echo $link_color;
}
 
We changed the value of $is_clicked to FALSE so that the if block will not run. Rather, the else block will run and blue will be printed to the terminal.

Let’s make some conditionals!

index.php
---------
<?php
namespace Codecademy;
function markAnswer($is_correct) {
  if ($is_correct) {
    return "green";
  } else {
    return "red";
  }
}

echo markAnswer(TRUE);
echo "\n";
echo markAnswer(FALSE);

* Comparison Operators
----------------------
The condition, or expression, in an if statement can hold a boolean value—like TRUE or FALSE, a variable assigned to one of those values, or an expression that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.

Just as we can represent a value of five with 5 or with an expression that evaluates to five e.g. 3 + 2, we can write expressions that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. Comparison operators 
evaluate a relationship between two operands and return a boolean value.

The less than operator (<) will return TRUE if the left operand is less than the right operand and FALSE if it’s not:

1 < 10; // Evaluates to: TRUE
11 < 3; // Evaluates to: FALSE
 
The less than or equal to operator (<=) will return TRUE if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand and FALSE if it’s not:

1 <= 10; // Evaluates to: TRUE
4 <= 4; // Evaluates to: TRUE
18 <= 2; // Evaluates to: FALSE
 
The greater than operator (>) will return TRUE if the left operand is greater than the right operand and FALSE if it’s not. And the greater than or equal to operator (>=) will return TRUE 
if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand and FALSE if it’s not:

1 > 10; // Evaluates to: FALSE
11 > 3; // Evaluates to: TRUE
1 >= 10; // Evaluates to: FALSE
11 >= 11; // Evaluates to: TRUE
54 >= 10; // Evaluates to: TRUE
 
Let’s practice writing conditionals using these operators!

index.php
---------
<?php
namespace Codecademy;

function chooseCheckoutLane($number_of_items) {
  if ($number_of_items <= 12) {
    return "express lane";
  } else {
    return "regular lane";
  }
}

function canIVote($age) {
  if ($age >= 18) {
    return "yes";
  } else {
    return "no";
  }
}

echo chooseCheckoutLane(12);
echo "\n";
echo chooseCheckoutLane(11);
echo "\n";
echo chooseCheckoutLane(13);
echo "\n";
echo canIVote(18);
echo "\n";
echo canIVote(19);
echo "\n";
echo canIVote(17);
